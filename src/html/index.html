					<span>Cabin Fever</span>
					<p>App that allows users to list personal property, like a mountain cabin, for rent. Users search for rentals by city and property type. They view up-to-date property details, and follow a link to the proprietary booking agent to make reservations. 
					Cabin Fever solves a problem specific to the North Georgia market. If a party searches for cabin rentals near Ellijay, Georgia, for example, they could search across a dozen or more independent sites in order to find a suitable property. The app allows users to search across these platforms in one easy step, making for a streamlined user experience.
